== Introduction

Augmentus is  a no-code and fully-integrated robotics platform that enables anyone – even those with no robotic experience or programming skills – to develop, deploy and re-purpose robotic systems in minutes. We strive to help businesses recoup return on investment faster by drastically lowering the time, cost, and skill barriers in implementing robotic systems.
